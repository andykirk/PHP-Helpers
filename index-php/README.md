index.php
=========

This is a generic PHP-based file indexer.

It's intended to be copy-pasted in a folder on a server and it'll simply list all the files it finds based on how its configured.

It's intended to be configured, altered, tweaked and everything else. It's more of a starting point than a black-box, albeit a starting-point that's useful "out of the box".
